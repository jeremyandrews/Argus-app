# Argus-App

**Project Brief (Overview)**

Argus is an iOS client that delivers AI-enhanced news updates from a dedicated backend. While the backend handles all RSS feed analysis, Argus for iOS focuses on providing users with a streamlined reading experience:

- **Priority & Notifications**: Subscribing to a topic is easy; if it’s flagged as “high priority,” new articles trigger push notifications. Otherwise, Argus downloads them in the background when you open the app.  
- **Rich Text Conversion**: Articles arrive from the server in Markdown format; Argus converts them to rich text so you can read comfortably, even offline.  
- **Organization & Filtering**: You can sort by date, topic, or other criteria, group articles as you wish, and track which ones you’ve already viewed.  
- **Bookmark & Share**: Quickly bookmark articles to revisit them later or share with friends.  
- **Deeper Insights**: Each article arrives with AI-driven critical and logical analyses, offering more context and helping you assess content reliability—without you ever leaving the Argus app.
