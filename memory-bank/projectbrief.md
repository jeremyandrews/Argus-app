# Project Brief: Argus iOS App

## Overview
Argus is an iOS client that delivers AI-enhanced news updates from a dedicated backend. The backend handles all RSS feed analysis, while Argus focuses on providing users with a streamlined reading experience.

## Core Features
- **Priority & Notifications**: Users can subscribe to topics and flag them as "high priority" to receive push notifications for new articles. Otherwise, content is downloaded in the background when the app is opened.
- **Rich Text Conversion**: Articles arrive from the server in Markdown format and Argus converts them to rich text for comfortable reading, even offline.
- **Organization & Filtering**: Users can sort by date, topic, or other criteria, group articles as desired, and track which ones they've already viewed.
- **Bookmark & Share**: Users can bookmark articles to revisit later or share with friends.
- **Deeper Insights**: Each article includes AI-driven critical and logical analyses, offering more context and helping users assess content reliabilityâ€”without leaving the Argus app.
