# Active Context: Argus iOS App

## Current Work Focus
- **Active Development Phase**: Stabilization and bug fixing
- **Primary Focus Areas**: Swift 6 concurrency compliance, UI performance, and duplicate content resolution
- **User Experience Improvements**: Addressing UI jitter during sync operations and fixing attributed string rendering issues

## Recent Changes
- Fixed duplicate article issue by making rich text generation synchronous:
  - Modified the `saveArticle` and `updateArticle` methods in DatabaseCoordinator to use synchronous rich text generation
  - Changed from fire-and-forget tasks (`Task { @MainActor in ... }`) to awaited calls (`await MainActor.run { ... }`)
  - Ensured rich text is generated before database transactions complete
- Fixed critical Swift 6 concurrency issues across multiple components:
  - Added @MainActor constraints to LazyLoadingContentView in NewsDetailView.swift
  - Fixed issue with NSAttributedString (non-Sendable) crossing actor boundaries
  - Eliminated "called from background thread" warnings in attributed string processing
  - Ensured proper main thread handling for UI-related operations
- Enhanced error handling for article fetching with better HTTP status code detection
- Fixed memory management in database access patterns to prevent leaks
- Improved thread safety in synchronization code using actor isolation

## Next Steps
1. **Verify Fixed Logs**:
   - Confirm that the Swift 6 concurrency fixes have eliminated all warning messages
   - Monitor app performance to ensure the actor-isolation changes haven't impacted responsiveness
   - Perform systematic testing of attributed string rendering in various UI components

2. **Fix UI Jitter During Sync**:
   - Now that rich text rendering is better handled, investigate remaining UI performance issues
   - Implement smoother UI transitions during background processing
   - Profile the app to identify any remaining performance bottlenecks

3. **Resolve Duplicate Content Issue**:
   - Address the duplicate notification ID errors fixed in our recent changes
   - Verify if the Swift 6 compliance changes have affected duplicate content issues
   - If still present, further analyze content synchronization logic

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Swift 6 Concurrency Compliance**: 
  - All NSAttributedString handling now properly respects actor isolation boundaries
  - Using @MainActor for UI-related operations that must run on the main thread
  - Avoiding background thread warnings with proper task contexts

- **Rich Text Performance**: 
  - The LazyLoadingContentView now uses a MainActor-constrained task for better efficiency
  - Consider if additional optimizations could further improve rich text rendering performance

- **Error Handling Strategy**: 
  - Enhanced handling of article fetching errors with proper HTTP status code detection
  - Consider adding more detailed diagnostics for article loading failures

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring that all attributed string operations properly respect actor isolation
- Preventing any NSAttributedString from crossing actor boundaries without proper handling
- Balancing between fixing concurrency issues and maintaining app performance

## Recent Feedback
- Users have reported log errors related to article not found and getAttributedString warnings
- Duplicate notification IDs causing unwanted error messages in logs
- UI performance during rich text rendering could use further optimization

## Immediate Priorities
1. Verify that all Swift 6 concurrency warning logs have been eliminated
2. Perform thorough testing of the rich text rendering functionality
3. Ensure that the fixes for duplicate notification IDs are working correctly
