# Active Context: Argus iOS App

## Current Work Focus
- **Active Development Phase**: Stabilization and bug fixing
- **Primary Focus Areas**: Sync process optimization, UI performance, and duplicate content resolution
- **User Experience Improvements**: Addressing UI jitter during sync operations

## Recent Changes
- Implemented DatabaseCoordinator as a centralized actor-based interface for all database operations
- Fixed Swift 6 concurrency issues in database operations
- Improved thread safety in synchronization code
- Addressing known technical debt items identified in the tech context

## Next Steps
1. **Fix UI Jitter During Sync**:
   - Investigate the cause of UI performance issues during sync operations
   - Implement smoother UI transitions during background processing
   - Consider moving sync operations to a separate thread or optimizing existing implementation

2. **Resolve Duplicate Content Issue**:
   - Analyze the content synchronization logic to identify the source of duplication
   - Implement deduplication mechanisms in the data layer
   - Add validation checks before displaying content

3. **Refactor Database Layer**:
   - Plan for incremental improvements to the database architecture
   - Document current database schema and pain points
   - Design migration strategy for future database changes

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Sync Process Optimization**: 
  - Evaluating whether to modify the existing sync process or implement a new approach
  - Considering impact on offline capabilities and data consistency

- **Database Refactoring**: 
  - Assessing options for making the database layer more adaptable to changes
  - Weighing the trade-offs between different persistence solutions

- **Error Handling Strategy**: 
  - Determining how to improve error reporting and recovery for network operations
  - Deciding on appropriate user feedback mechanisms for sync failures

## Current Challenges
- Maintaining smooth UI performance while handling background synchronization
- Ensuring data consistency across sync operations
- Balancing between fixing existing issues and adding new features

## Recent Feedback
- Users have reported UI performance issues during sync operations
- Duplicate content appears in some scenarios, affecting user experience
- Database layer flexibility is limiting the ease of implementing certain features

## Immediate Priorities
1. Address performance issues affecting user experience
2. Fix data consistency problems causing duplicate content
3. Improve stability of sync operations
