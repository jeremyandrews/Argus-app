# Active Context: Argus iOS App

## Current Work Focus
- **Active Development Phase**: Stabilization and bug fixing
- **Primary Focus Areas**: Sync process optimization, UI performance, and duplicate content resolution
- **User Experience Improvements**: Addressing UI jitter during sync operations

## Recent Changes
- Completed DatabaseCoordinator implementation with Swift 6 concurrency safety
  - Fixed all actor-isolation and concurrency warnings
  - Eliminated redundant array extension to avoid conflicts
  - Refactored code to properly handle variable capture in closures
- Removed unused variable in SyncManager's processArticlesDetached method
- Fixed memory management in database access patterns to prevent leaks
- Improved thread safety in synchronization code using actor isolation

## Next Steps
1. **Fix UI Jitter During Sync**:
   - Now that the DatabaseCoordinator is complete with proper concurrency, investigate UI performance issues
   - Implement smoother UI transitions during background processing
   - Profile the app to identify any remaining performance bottlenecks

2. **Resolve Duplicate Content Issue**:
   - Verify if the DatabaseCoordinator changes have affected duplicate content issues
   - If still present, further analyze content synchronization logic
   - Implement additional deduplication mechanisms if needed

3. **Test Database Operations Under Load**:
   - Create stress tests to verify DatabaseCoordinator stability
   - Benchmark performance of batch operations
   - Identify any remaining optimization opportunities

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Sync Process Optimization**: 
  - Now using DatabaseCoordinator consistently for all database operations
  - Need to evaluate the impact of these changes on sync performance

- **Database Refactoring**: 
  - DatabaseCoordinator now provides a centralized, thread-safe interface
  - Consider if further refinements to the coordinator pattern would be beneficial

- **Error Handling Strategy**: 
  - Evaluate if the current error handling in DatabaseCoordinator is sufficient
  - Consider adding more detailed diagnostics for database operations

## Current Challenges
- Verifying that Swift 6 concurrency fixes don't introduce new issues
- Ensuring consistency across all code using the DatabaseCoordinator
- Balancing between fixing existing issues and adding new features

## Recent Feedback
- Users have reported UI performance issues during sync operations
- Duplicate content appears in some scenarios, affecting user experience
- Database layer flexibility has improved with the coordinator pattern

## Immediate Priorities
1. Verify that all database operations now use DatabaseCoordinator consistently
2. Test synchronization with large datasets to ensure performance
3. Address any remaining UI performance issues during sync operations
