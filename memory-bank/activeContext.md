## Recent Changes

- **Fixed Rich Text Blob Architectural Issue** (Completed, Partial Success):
  - Addressed architectural disconnect between model context and UI views:
    - Fixed core issue: NewsDetailView was creating its own ViewModel, losing SwiftData model context
    - Modified NewsDetailView to accept pre-configured ViewModel via constructor pattern that maintains context:
      ```swift
      init(viewModel: NewsDetailViewModel) {
          _viewModel = ObservedObject(initialValue: viewModel)
          self.initiallyExpandedSection = viewModel.initiallyExpandedSection
      }
      ```
    - Updated all initialization points (AppDelegate.swift, NewsView.swift) to use new constructor pattern
    - Fixed UIModalPresentationStyle references to use proper Swift enum
    - Removed references to no-longer-exists properties (notifications, allNotifications, currentIndex)
    - Updated SimilarArticleRow to no longer use the removed bindings
  - Status after fix:
    - Log analysis shows blobs **are** now being correctly saved to the database:
      - Success message: `✅ Saved blob for criticalAnalysis to database (11551 bytes)`
      - Success message: `✅ Successfully saved blob to database model`
      - Success message: `✅ Blob saved to database (11551 bytes)`
    - CloudKit is properly syncing the blobs to iCloud:
      - Log shows successful record creation: `<CKRecord: 0x10fa16280>`
      - Log shows modified blob fields: `"CD_criticalAnalysisBlob", "CD_titleBlob", "CD_bodyBlob"`
      - Log confirms CloudKit export success: `CoreData: warning: CoreData+CloudKit: Finished export`
    - However, there are still some issues that need further investigation:
      - Error remains for some articles: `⚠️ Article 2F1B3CEA-BE44-4F30-944E-E0115CB334F7 has no model context - not saved to database`
      - This suggests some article instances are still being created without a proper model context
      - Interestingly, even with this error, the system recovers: `⚙️ PHASE 2: Blob loading failed, attempting rich text generation for Critical Analysis`
  - Future investigation needed:
    - Trace complete context propagation path to ensure no article instances miss getting a SwiftData context
    - Verify ArticleModel creation in NewsDetailViewModel is always capturing model context
    - Review all places in the app that create NotificationData objects to ensure they maintain context
    - Add more robust fallback mechanisms for cases where context is missing
    - Enhance logging around context assignment to pinpoint exactly where we're losing it

- **Diagnosed Rich Text Blob Storage Architectural Limitations** (In Progress):
  - Implemented partial fixes for rich text blobs not being saved to database:
    - Root cause identified: Architectural disconnect between models and view initialization flow
    - Primary issue: NotificationData objects lose SwiftData model context when converted from ArticleModel
    - Log evidence: `⚠️ Article 0B3B3CC6-9536-48D8-88EC-485152E8738E has no model context - not saved to database`
    - Core architectural conflict: NewsDetailView creates its own ViewModel internally, ignoring externally created ViewModel
  - Implemented a two-model synchronization approach:
    - Added `getArticleModelWithContext(byId:)` to ArticleOperations to retrieve intact database model
    - Added `saveBlobToDatabase(field:blobData:articleModel:)` method for direct database blob storage
    - Added support in NewsDetailViewModel for tracking and using ArticleModel alongside NotificationData
    - Modified NewsView+Extensions to fetch and prepare ArticleModel when opening articles
    - Fixed string interpolation compiler errors with RichTextField enum
    - Added comprehensive logging for blob saving operations
  - Current state and limitations:
    - Log shows successful ArticleModel fetch: `✅ Found ArticleModel with valid context for ID: 0B3B3CC6-9536-48D8-88EC-485152E8738E`
    - Log shows successful blob saving: `✅ Successfully saved blob to database model`
    - Blobs exist in database but aren't loaded between sessions due to architectural disconnect
    - Fundamental issue: NewsDetailView initializer creates its own ViewModel instead of using our pre-configured one
  - Architectural resolution requires:
    - Modifying NewsDetailView to accept a pre-configured ViewModel rather than creating its own
    - Or adding a secondary initializer to NewsDetailView that accepts a ViewModel directly 
    - Better adherence to MVVM by creating ViewModels at a higher level and injecting them into views
  - Created diagnostic tool (blob-diagnostic.swift) to analyze and verify database state
  - Learned valuable architectural insights about SwiftData context propagation:
    - Model context is lost when converting between models, requiring explicit context preservation
    - Using the right model for each operation is critical for database persistence
    - Nested view creation can cause dependency injection issues with ViewModels
    - Properly documenting architectural dependencies is essential for future maintainability

- **Fixed Rich Text Blob Storage Issue** (Completed):
  - Resolved issue with rich text blobs not being properly saved to database:
    - Root cause: Articles without a SwiftData model context could not persist their generated rich text
    - Log symptoms: `⚠️ Article has no model context - not saved to database`, `⚠️ No model context to save blob`
    - Error impact: Users had to regenerate section content like "Critical Analysis" on each view
  - Implemented a three-part solution:
    - Added `getArticleWithContext` method to ArticleOperations to retrieve database-backed articles
    - Restructured the rich text generation and blob saving process in NewsDetailViewModel:
      - Separated generation (inside timeout function) from blob saving (outside timeout)
      - Added support for saving blobs to both in-memory article and database-persisted copy
    - Enhanced diagnostic logging for model context and blob verification
  - Fixed compiler error with Swift concurrency:
    - Removed `await MainActor.run` usage inside timeout function which caused compiler error
    - Refactored to move async operations outside the timeout block for proper execution
  - Implemented a more robust pattern for blob management:
    - Three-phase loading: check blob cache → generate rich text → save persistent copy
    - Added error handling for each phase with proper fallbacks
    - Added verification step to confirm successful database storage
  - This fix ensures rich text content is properly persisted across app sessions, significantly improving user experience when viewing article sections

- **Fixed ArticleService Thread-Safety Issue** (Completed):
  - Resolved app crash caused by thread-safety issue in ArticleService cache operations:
    - Error: `-[NSIndexPath member:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x8000000000000000`
    - Root cause: Concurrent access to `cacheKeys` set from multiple threads
    - Fixed by implementing proper thread isolation using serial dispatch queue
  - Implemented comprehensive thread-safety improvements:
    - Added `cacheQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.argus.articleservice.cache")` for isolation
    - Modified `cacheResults()` to run async on the queue when writing to cache
    - Updated `checkCache()` to synchronously access cache with thread safety
    - Refactored `clearCache()` into async public method and sync private implementation
    - Implemented safe cache accessors: `hasCacheKey()`, `cacheSize()`, `isCacheExpired()`
    - Added `withSafeCache<T>()` helper for generic safe cache operations
  - Enhanced async handling for cache operations:
    - Used `withCheckedContinuation` when calling `clearCache()` from async methods
    - Added comprehensive logging for cache operations with ModernizationLogger
    - Properly handled self-reference in closures with explicit syntax
  - Modernized ArticleService class documentation:
    - Added thread-safety documentation to class-level comment
    - Improved method documentation with thread-safety details
  - This fix follows modern Swift concurrency best practices:
    - Used dedicated dispatch queue for thread isolation
    - Implemented async/sync patterns appropriate to operation type
    - Ensured all mutable state access is properly synchronized
    - Applied consistent error handling and logging throughout
  - Key learnings for future development:
    - All shared mutable state needs explicit synchronization
    - Singletons require special attention to thread-safety
    - Cache operations benefit from serial queue isolation
    - Proper logging is essential for diagnosing concurrency issues

- **Implemented Modern Settings Observation** (Completed):
  - Fixed display preferences in Settings not affecting the NewsView and NodeDetailView:
    - Created dedicated UserDefaultsExtensions.swift for standardized settings access
    - Implemented Combine-based observation of UserDefaults changes in ViewModels
    - Standardized "date" as the default grouping style across components
    - Enhanced NewsViewModel to handle immediate UI updates when settings change
    - Enhanced NewsDetailViewModel for settings observation infrastructure
    - Added proper memory management with subscription cancellation in deinit
  - Added typed key constants to avoid stringly-typed programming
  - Implemented computed properties for all relevant UserDefaults settings
  - Used modern iOS 18+ patterns with Combine publishers for reactive settings updates
  - Achieved real-time UI updates in response to settings changes without app restart
  - Fixed inconsistency between SettingsView and NewsViewModel default values

- **Fixed App Badge Count Issues** (Completed):
  - Resolved issues with the app badge not showing unread count:
    - Fixed database model mismatch:
      - Changed NotificationUtils to query ArticleModel through ArticleService instead of querying legacy NotificationData model
      - Created new `countUnviewedArticles()` method in ArticleService that uses the correct SwiftData model
      - Added comprehensive error handling and logging to track badge count numbers
    - Added notification permission check:
      - Created `hasNotificationPermission()` method to verify if user has granted notification permissions
      - Added guard clause to prevent badge updates when permissions aren't granted
      - Implemented warning logs when permissions are missing to aid in debugging
    - Fixed Swift 6 concurrency issues:
      - Added @MainActor annotation to countUnviewedArticles() to properly isolate SwiftData context access
      - Properly accessed SwiftData context from the main actor without crossing actor boundaries
      - Removed await from main actor-isolated property that would have violated Swift 6 sendability rules
    - Improved logging with correct components:
      - Used articleService component instead of non-existent database component in ModernizationLogger
      - Added detailed logging at each step of the badge update process
    - Previous fixes (still relevant):
      - Fixed API methods from previous update: `UNUserNotificationCenter.setBadgeCount(count, withCompletionHandler:)`
      - Maintained proper debounce logic to prevent excessive badge updates
      - Ensured updates happen at all required lifecycle events
  - Key lessons for future development:
    - Always add @MainActor annotation when accessing SwiftData contexts in methods
    - Never use await when accessing main actor-isolated properties from @MainActor-annotated code
    - Always check notification permissions before attempting to update badges
    - Query the correct database model when models have been migrated
    - Use comprehensive error handling and logging when working with system APIs

- **Investigated Missing Engine Stats and Related Articles Issues** (In Progress):
  - Found clues about chevron navigation issues:
    - Diagnostic logging in ArticleService.swift shows awareness of potential missing fields
    - Debug checks show that engine_stats and similar_articles might exist in database 
      but not be properly transferred during conversion between models
    - NavigationTypes.swift implementation appears correct with shared enum
    - The NavigationDirection enums are used consistently in the codebase
  - Potential issue areas:
    - ArticleModelAdapter conversion between SwiftData ArticleModel and legacy NotificationData
    - Data handling during NewsDetailViewModel.navigateToArticle method execution
    - Potential disconnect between what's in the database and what's loaded during navigation
    - Loading sequence might not preserve all fields when navigating between articles
  - Further investigation needed:
    - Trace complete data flow during chevron navigation
    - Add more diagnostic logging around model conversion
    - Verify complete article loading during navigation includes all required fields

- **Removed Archive Functionality** (Completed):
  - Removed the archive concept completely from the codebase:
    - Removed `toggleArchive` function from ArticleOperations.swift
    - Updated `fetchArticles` method to remove archive parameters 
    - Removed archive batch operations from ArticleOperations.swift
    - Removed `markArticle(id:asArchived:)` method from ArticleService.swift
    - Removed `markArticle(id:asArchived:)` method from MigrationAwareArticleService.swift
    - Removed archive-related UI comments from view files
    - Maintained backward compatibility with two-part strategy:
      - Kept `isArchived` property in legacy `NotificationData` model for database compatibility with existing installations
      - Omitted `isArchived` property from new `ArticleModel` (SwiftData model) as the concept is removed
      - ArticleModelAdapter converts between models, with isArchived always set to false
      - During migration, isArchived status is effectively discarded (not migrated to new model)
      - All parameters/methods accepting isArchived keep it for API compatibility but ignore the value in processing
  - Benefits:
    - Simplified article lifecycle to just read/unread and bookmarked/unbookmarked
    - Improved UX by removing a confusing concept
    - Reduced code complexity and maintenance burden
    - Streamlined UI with clearer state management

    - Previously sent empty arrays which caused server to return ALL articles
    - Added database query with time-based filtering (`addedDate >= twelveHoursAgo`)
    - Limited payload size to maximum 200 entries to prevent oversized requests
    - Added comprehensive error handling with fallback to empty list if database query fails
    - Implemented detailed logging to track sync article counts
  - Benefits of this fix:
    - Significantly reduced server load and response times
    - Decreased network payload sizes
    - Prevented timeouts during large sync operations
    - Made client properly follow the incremental sync protocol
  - Implementation follows Swift best practices:

    3. Opening other sections like Critical Analysis would hang with "Converting text..."
  - Implemented robust sequential loading process with improved diagnostics:
    - Created a clear three-phase loading approach:
      - Phase 1: Check for blobs in the database (fastest path)
      - Phase 2: Only attempt rich text generation if blob loading fails
      - Phase 3: Fall back to plain text display as a last resort
    - Added comprehensive logging at each phase with detailed timing information
    - Reduced timeout from 5 seconds to 3 seconds for faster response
    - Added proper cancellation handling to prevent resource leaks
    - Improved error presentation with fallback content when sections can't be loaded
