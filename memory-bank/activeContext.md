- **Fixed App Badge Count Issues** (Completed):
  - Resolved issues with the app badge not showing unread count:
    - Fixed database model mismatch:
      - Changed NotificationUtils to query ArticleModel through ArticleService instead of querying legacy NotificationData model
      - Created new `countUnviewedArticles()` method in ArticleService that uses the correct SwiftData model
      - Added comprehensive error handling and logging to track badge count numbers
    - Added notification permission check:
      - Created `hasNotificationPermission()` method to verify if user has granted notification permissions
      - Added guard clause to prevent badge updates when permissions aren't granted
      - Implemented warning logs when permissions are missing to aid in debugging
    - Fixed Swift 6 concurrency issues:
      - Added @MainActor annotation to countUnviewedArticles() to properly isolate SwiftData context access
      - Properly accessed SwiftData context from the main actor without crossing actor boundaries
      - Removed await from main actor-isolated property that would have violated Swift 6 sendability rules
    - Improved logging with correct components:
      - Used articleService component instead of non-existent database component in ModernizationLogger
      - Added detailed logging at each step of the badge update process
    - Previous fixes (still relevant):
      - Fixed API methods from previous update: `UNUserNotificationCenter.setBadgeCount(count, withCompletionHandler:)`
      - Maintained proper debounce logic to prevent excessive badge updates
      - Ensured updates happen at all required lifecycle events
  - Key lessons for future development:

    - Always check notification permissions before attempting to update badges
    - Query the correct database model when models have been migrated
    - Use comprehensive error handling and logging when working with system APIs

- **Investigated Missing Engine Stats and Related Articles Issues** (In Progress):
  - Found clues about chevron navigation issues:
    - Diagnostic logging in ArticleService.swift shows awareness of potential missing fields
    - Debug checks show that engine_stats and similar_articles might exist in database 
      but not be properly transferred during conversion between models
    - NavigationTypes.swift implementation appears correct with shared enum
    - The NavigationDirection enums are used consistently in the codebase
  - Potential issue areas:
    - ArticleModelAdapter conversion between SwiftData ArticleModel and legacy NotificationData
    - Data handling during NewsDetailViewModel.navigateToArticle method execution
    - Potential disconnect between what's in the database and what's loaded during navigation
    - Loading sequence might not preserve all fields when navigating between articles

    - Add more diagnostic logging around model conversion
    - Verify complete article loading during navigation includes all required fields

- **Removed Archive Functionality** (Completed):
  - Removed the archive concept completely from the codebase:
    - Removed `toggleArchive` function from ArticleOperations.swift
    - Updated `fetchArticles` method to remove archive parameters 
    - Removed archive batch operations from ArticleOperations.swift
    - Removed `markArticle(id:asArchived:)` method from ArticleService.swift
    - Removed `markArticle(id:asArchived:)` method from MigrationAwareArticleService.swift
    - Removed archive-related UI comments from view files
    - Maintained backward compatibility with two-part strategy:
      - Kept `isArchived` property in legacy `NotificationData` model for database compatibility with existing installations
      - Omitted `isArchived` property from new `ArticleModel` (SwiftData model) as the concept is removed
      - ArticleModelAdapter converts between models, with isArchived always set to false
      - During migration, isArchived status is effectively discarded (not migrated to new model)
      - All parameters/methods accepting isArchived keep it for API compatibility but ignore the value in processing
  - Benefits:
    - Simplified article lifecycle to just read/unread and bookmarked/unbookmarked

    - Added database query with time-based filtering (`addedDate >= twelveHoursAgo`)
    - Limited payload size to maximum 200 entries to prevent oversized requests
    - Added comprehensive error handling with fallback to empty list if database query fails
    - Implemented detailed logging to track sync article counts
  - Benefits of this fix:
    - Significantly reduced server load and response times
    - Decreased network payload sizes

## Recent Discoveries from Logs

Based on recent application logs and code analysis, we've identified several important issues:

1. **CloudKit Integration Issues** (Resolved):
   - Previous errors (now fixed):
     - CloudKit integration setup errors: `"Failed to set up CloudKit integration for store"`
     - Server rejection errors: `"Server Rejected Request" (15/2000)`
     - Failed recovery attempts with error: `CKErrorDomain:15`
   - Root causes identified and fixed:
     - False success detection in container initialization (now properly verifies with actual operations)
     - Request conflicts from multiple simultaneous operations (now properly queued)
     - Missing error handling and recovery paths (now implemented with state machine)
     - Improper thermal state handling (fixed comparison logic)
     - Deprecated API usage (updated to modern equivalents)
   - Solution implemented:
     - Created CloudKitHealthMonitor for operational verification
     - Implemented CloudKitRequestCoordinator for request management
     - Added graceful degradation to local storage when CloudKit unavailable
     - Enhanced user messaging through notification system
     - Implemented automatic recovery when conditions improve

2. **API Client/Server Mismatch Issues**:
   - 404 errors when trying to reach API endpoints: `Response status code: 404`
   - Resource not found errors: `"The requested resource was not found"`
   - Error propagation through multiple layers: `Error performing startup maintenance: Argus.ArticleServiceError.networkError(...)`
   - Root cause identified: Client code assumes endpoints that don't exist in server implementation:
     - Client tries to call `/articles/{id}` endpoint which doesn't exist on server
     - Client attempts direct article content fetching which isn't implemented on server
     - The server only provides `/articles/sync` endpoint that returns URLs, not content
   - **Action required**: Refactor APIClient.swift to remove calls to non-existent endpoints
   - **Added to roadmap**: Replace current API client implementation with one that only uses valid API endpoints

3. **Migration Behavior**:
   - Migration running repeatedly on each app launch: `"Fetched 2774 articles for migration"` appears multiple times in logs
   - State synchronization working correctly: `"Updated state for article ID..."`
   - Duplicate detection functioning properly: `"No duplicates found to remove"`

4. **Network Performance Issues**:
   - Network connection timing problems: `"Hit maximum timestamp count, will start dropping events"`
   - This may impact reliable synchronization with the backend

## Next Steps
