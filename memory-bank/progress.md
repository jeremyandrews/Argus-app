## Recently Completed

- âœ… **Removed Archive Functionality** (Completed):
  - Removed the archive concept completely from the codebase:
    - Removed `toggleArchive` function from ArticleOperations.swift
    - Updated `fetchArticles` method in ArticleOperations.swift to remove archive parameters
    - Removed archive batch operation from ArticleOperations.swift
    - Removed `markArticle(id:asArchived:)` method from ArticleService.swift
    - Removed `markArticle(id:asArchived:)` method from MigrationAwareArticleService.swift
    - Added comments in affected files indicating that archive functionality was removed
    - Implemented backward compatibility with two-part strategy:
      - Kept `isArchived` property in legacy `NotificationData` model for database compatibility with existing installations
      - Omitted `isArchived` property from new `ArticleModel` (SwiftData model) as the concept is removed going forward
      - ArticleModelAdapter always sets isArchived to false when converting between models
      - During migration, isArchived status is effectively discarded (not migrated to new model)
      - All methods accepting isArchived parameter keep it for API compatibility but ignore it in processing
    - Removed all archive-related UI code comments from view files
  - This simplifies the article lifecycle and user interface by:
    - Reducing the number of article states to just read/unread and bookmarked/unbookmarked
    - Simplifying filtering options in the NewsView
    - Creating a more intuitive user experience by removing confusing conceptual overlap
    - Streamlining database operations by removing a now-unnecessary flag
    - Ensuring compatibility with existing user databases

- âœ… **Fixed API Sync Error by Optimizing seen_articles List** (Completed):
  - Fixed critical timeout issue by improving how the client reports seen articles to the server:
    - Modified `fetchArticleURLs()` method to only include articles from the last 12 hours
    - Previously sent empty arrays causing the server to return ALL articles
    - Added time-based filtering with `addedDate >= twelveHoursAgo` predicate
    - Limited entries to maximum 200 to prevent oversized requests
    - Added fallback to empty list if database query fails
  - This fix prevents timeouts during syncing by:
    - Reducing server load (only needs to process recent articles)
    - Decreasing network payload sizes (fewer articles to transfer)
    - Following the proper incremental sync protocol as designed 
    - Making sync operations much faster and more reliable
