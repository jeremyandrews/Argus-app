  - Created Combine-based observation in ViewModels for real-time settings updates
  - Standardized default values across components ("date" as default grouping style)
  - Added proper memory management for subscriptions

- ‚úÖ **Fixed Rich Text Blob Architectural Issue** (Completed, with partial success):
  - Addressed architectural disconnect between model context and UI views:
    - Fixed core issue: NewsDetailView was creating its own ViewModel, losing SwiftData model context
    - Modified NewsDetailView to accept pre-configured ViewModel via constructor pattern that maintains context:
      ```swift
      init(viewModel: NewsDetailViewModel) {
          _viewModel = ObservedObject(initialValue: viewModel)
          self.initiallyExpandedSection = viewModel.initiallyExpandedSection
      }
      ```
    - Updated all initialization points (AppDelegate.swift, NewsView.swift) to use new constructor pattern
    - Fixed UIModalPresentationStyle references to use proper Swift enum
    - Removed references to no-longer-existing properties (notifications, allNotifications, currentIndex)
    - Updated SimilarArticleRow to no longer use the removed bindings
  - Status after fix:
    - Log analysis shows blobs **are** now being correctly saved to the database:
      - Success message: `‚úÖ Saved blob for criticalAnalysis to database (11551 bytes)`
      - Success message: `‚úÖ Successfully saved blob to database model`
      - Success message: `‚úÖ Blob saved to database (11551 bytes)`
    - CloudKit is properly syncing the blobs to iCloud:
      - Log shows successful record creation: `<CKRecord: 0x10fa16280>`
      - Log shows modified blob fields: `"CD_criticalAnalysisBlob", "CD_titleBlob", "CD_bodyBlob"`
      - Log confirms CloudKit export success: `CoreData: warning: CoreData+CloudKit: Finished export`
    - However, there are still some issues that need further investigation:
      - Error remains for some articles: `‚ö†Ô∏è Article 2F1B3CEA-BE44-4F30-944E-E0115CB334F7 has no model context - not saved to database`
      - This suggests some article instances are still being created without a proper model context
      - Interestingly, even with this error, the system recovers: `‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 2: Blob loading failed, attempting rich text generation for Critical Analysis`
  - Future investigation needed:
    - Trace complete context propagation path to ensure no article instances miss getting a SwiftData context
    - Verify ArticleModel creation in NewsDetailViewModel is always capturing model context
    - Review all places in the app that create NotificationData objects to ensure they maintain context
    - Add more robust fallback mechanisms for cases where context is missing
    - Enhance logging around context assignment to pinpoint exactly where we're losing it

  - Shared components architecture implemented (ArticleServiceProtocol, ArticleService, ArticleOperations)
  - ViewModels created (NewsViewModel, NewsDetailViewModel)
  - View refactoring completed for NewsView to use the new ViewModel
  - Fixed container disconnect between SwiftData Test and main app

- ‚úÖ **Migration System Simplification** (Completed)
  - ‚úÖ Removed dual-implementation pattern in MigrationAwareArticleService by eliminating write-back operations
  - ‚úÖ Added deprecation annotations to MigrationAwareArticleService to encourage direct use of ArticleService
  - ‚úÖ Maintained read-only access to legacy database for migration purposes only

    - Fixed other sections like Critical Analysis hanging forever when expanding them
    - Fixed Swift compiler warnings and errors for proper compilation
  - Implemented a robust sequential loading process with improved diagnostics:
    - Created a clear three-phase loading approach:
      - Phase 1: Check for blobs in the database (fastest path)
      - Phase 2: Only attempt rich text generation if blob loading fails
      - Phase 3: Fall back to plain text display as a last resort
    - Added comprehensive logging at each phase with detailed timing information

    - Updated `fetchArticles` method in ArticleOperations.swift to remove archive parameters
    - Removed archive batch operation from ArticleOperations.swift
    - Removed `markArticle(id:asArchived:)` method from ArticleService.swift
    - Removed `markArticle(id:asArchived:)` method from MigrationAwareArticleService.swift
    - Added comments in affected files indicating that archive functionality was removed

      - Kept `isArchived` property in legacy `NotificationData` model for database compatibility with existing installations
      - Omitted `isArchived` property from new `ArticleModel` (SwiftData model) as the concept is removed going forward
      - ArticleModelAdapter always sets isArchived to false when converting between models
      - During migration, isArchived status is effectively discarded (not migrated to new model)
      - All methods accepting isArchived parameter keep it for API compatibility but ignore it in processing

    - Previously sent empty arrays causing the server to return ALL articles
    - Added time-based filtering with `addedDate >= twelveHoursAgo` predicate
    - Limited entries to maximum 200 to prevent oversized requests
    - Added fallback to empty list if database query fails
  - This fix prevents timeouts during syncing by:
    - Reducing server load (only needs to process recent articles)
