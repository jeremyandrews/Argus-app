  - Fixed all actor-isolation and variable capture warnings
  - Eliminated redundant code to avoid conflicts with existing utilities
  - Added proper handling of concurrent database operations

- âœ… **Thread Safety Enhancements**
  - Improved handling of shared state in background tasks
  - Added safeguards against race conditions in database operations

## What's Left To Build

### Modernization Plan Implementation

#### Phase 1: Setup and Model Migration
- âœ… **Define SwiftData Models**
  - Created Article, SeenArticle, and Topic models with SwiftData annotations
  - Ensured fields align with backend API structure 
  - Applied unique constraints to prevent duplicates
  - Designed model relationships with proper cascade rules
- âœ… **Initialize SwiftData Container**
  - Created dedicated SwiftDataContainer class to isolate new models during transition
  - Configured ModelContainer with proper schema and persistence options
  - Added test interface (SwiftDataTestView) to verify SwiftData operations 
  - Integrated with Settings view for developer testing

- ðŸ”² **Migrate Existing Data (Optional)**
  - Create migration routine for converting old data to SwiftData models
  - Implement fallback to fetch fresh data if local data is incompatible

#### Phase 2: Networking and API Refactor
- ðŸ”² **Create Article API Client**
  - Refactor APIClient to use async/await for all API calls
  - Implement fetchArticles(), fetchArticle(by id:), and authenticateDevice(token:)
  - Enhance error handling with proper status code detection

- ðŸ”² **Build ArticleService**
  - Create bridge between API and SwiftData
  - Implement updateArticlesFromServer(), fetchArticles(), and saveArticle(_:)
  - Set up proper concurrency handling

#### Phase 3: MVVM Implementation and UI Refactor
- ðŸ”² **Refactor NewsView to Use ViewModel**
  - Create NewsViewModel with observable articles, loading state, and refresh method
  - Update NewsView to use StateObject ViewModel pattern
  - Replace manual fetches with ViewModel properties

- ðŸ”² **Implement ArticleDetailViewModel**
  - Handle article body Markdown rendering
  - Manage read/bookmark state
  - Refactor ArticleDetailView to use ViewModel

- ðŸ”² **Refactor SubscriptionsView and SettingsView**
  - Add ViewModels for topic preferences and settings
  - Migrate UI logic out of SwiftUI views

#### Phase 4: Syncing and Background Tasks
- ðŸ”² **Implement Periodic Sync Using .backgroundTask**
  - Schedule periodic sync with modern background task API
  - Set up ArticleService integration for background updates
  - Handle proper task expiration with cancellation

- ðŸ”² **Handle Push Notifications for New Articles**
  - Refactor AppDelegate for async push notification handling
  - Set up ArticleService integration for push-triggered fetches
  - Implement proper UI refresh on push receipt

#### Phase 5: Testing and Cleanup
- ðŸ”² **Test Data Migration and Persistence**
  - Verify SwiftData migration or fallback logic
  - Test offline behavior and article consistency

- ðŸ”² **Validate Syncing and Push Behavior**
  - Test background sync and push notification handling
  - Ensure proper article updates in all scenarios

- ðŸ”² **Performance and Battery Profiling**
  - Use Instruments to verify optimal resource usage
  - Ensure UI responsiveness during sync operations

- ðŸ”² **Remove Legacy Code**
  - Remove SyncManager, DatabaseCoordinator, and NotificationCenter-based state
  - Ensure all functionality is handled by new architecture

### Previous Planned Features
- ðŸ”² **Enhanced Social Sharing**
  - More comprehensive sharing options
  - Share with comments functionality
  
- ðŸ”² **Content Feedback**
  - Like/dislike functionality for articles
  - Feedback mechanisms for AI analysis
  
- ðŸ”² **Improved Error Handling**
  - More user-friendly error messages
  - Better recovery mechanisms for failed operations
