  - Added more comprehensive error messages for failed article retrievals
  - Fixed duplicate notification ID errors in logs

- âœ… **DatabaseCoordinator Implementation**
  - Completed full implementation with Swift 6 concurrency safety
  - Fixed all actor-isolation and variable capture warnings
  - Eliminated redundant code to avoid conflicts with existing utilities
  - Added proper handling of concurrent database operations

- âœ… **Thread Safety Enhancements**
  - Improved handling of shared state in background tasks
  - Added safeguards against race conditions in database operations

## What's Left To Build

- ðŸ”² **Enhanced Social Sharing**
  - More comprehensive sharing options
  - Share with comments functionality
  
- ðŸ”² **Content Feedback**
  - Like/dislike functionality for articles
  - Feedback mechanisms for AI analysis
  
- ðŸ”² **Improved Error Handling**

  - Better recovery mechanisms for failed operations

## Known Issues

1. **UI Performance**
   - Interface becomes jittery during synchronization
   - Status: May be partially improved by recent NSAttributedString handling fixes
   - Priority: High
   
2. **Database Limitations**
   - Current database design is difficult to modify
   - Status: Improved by DatabaseCoordinator implementation; assessment ongoing
   - Priority: Medium

## Testing Status

- âœ… **Unit Tests**
  - Core business logic tests passing
  - Coverage: ~70% of non-UI code
  
- ðŸ”¶ **UI Tests**
  - Basic navigation tests implemented
  - Detailed feature tests in progress
  
- ðŸ”¶ **Performance Testing**
  - Basic performance tests for DatabaseCoordinator planned
  - Manual testing reveals sync performance issues

## Next Milestone Goals

1. **Performance Release (Target: April 2025)**
   - Fix UI jitter during sync
   - Resolve duplicate content issues
   - Implement basic performance tests
   - Verify DatabaseCoordinator under load

2. **User Feedback Release (Target: May 2025)**
   - Add like/dislike functionality
   - Implement feedback mechanisms for AI analysis
   - Improve error handling and user messaging

## Progress Metrics
